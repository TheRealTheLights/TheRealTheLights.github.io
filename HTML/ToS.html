                <p>Wattlesborough Tower is a ruined fortified 13th-century manor house or Tower House in Shropshire.</p>
                <p>It is situated close to the boundary with Powys in Wales.</p>
                <p>Wattlesborough is a former township within the present parish of Alberbury.</p>
                <p>The castle is a Grade 1 listed scheduled monument.</p>
                <p>The Tower comprises a square two-storey tower above an undercroft surrounded by a moated enclosure with a fishpond.</p>
                <p>The Leighton family inherited Wattlesborough in 1471 and used it as their chief residence until circa 1711.</p>
                <p>At that time an adjoining farm building was constructed and named Wattlesborough Hall.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The plant is found in Patagonia, southern Argentina, as well as in central and southern Chile.</p>
                <p>The shrub grows in arid areas in sandy soil, sand dunes or on rocks, in full sun and can grow</p>
                <p>up to one meter in height.</p>
